## 🔬 Research Focus

I build **statistically rigorous, explainable ML systems** that translate complex data into actionable insights for vulnerable populations across three domains:

| Domain | Current Work | Impact |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Mental Health Analytics** | XAI-enhanced classifiers for psychological distress prediction among Kenyan university students (Tharaka Nithi County) | Published framework achieving high accuracy with full clinical interpretability via SHAP/LIME |
| **Infectious Disease Modeling** | Explainable AI models for malaria risk prediction in Kenya; neonatal mortality forecasting using survival analysis | Comparative evaluation of Cox PH vs. Random Survival Forests for neonatal outcomes |
| **Climate-Food Security** | **PhD Research**: Hybrid statistical-ML frameworks for spatiotemporal forecasting of climate-driven food insecurity across Kenya's agroecological zones | Integrating satellite remote sensing (NDVI, Sentinel-2), CHIRPS rainfall data, and socio-economic surveys for early-warning systems |
